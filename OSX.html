        <div id="description">
            <p>This tool consists of two scripts, an AppleScript and a Bash script. The Applescript collects the filepath to the current directory, opens a terminal window, and executes the Bash script. The Bash script collects the user’s uniqname, and uses it to open an ssh connection with rsync in order to gain access to the user’s AFS space. The user then must authenticate and acknowledge they are connecting to a University of Michigan server, and then rsync utility will copy the user’s entire AFS space to a directory named their uniqname in their downloads directory. The download can be interrupted at anytime without issue. Simply re-run the application and the download will pick up where it was interrupted.</p>

        <div id="poweruser_notes">
            <p>Notes for power users: this rsync is run with -p enabled, so that permissions will be preserved. Hidden files are excluded from being copied.
