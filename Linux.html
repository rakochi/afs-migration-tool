        <h4>Tool Specifics:</h4>
        <div id="description">
            <p>This tool is a bash script for Linux users to copy files from their AFS directory to their local computer using the rsync utility. It can be executed in OS X following the same directions as listed below. This script does not copy hidden files, but that can be amended by removing both of the --exclude flags from the rsync command. The rsync utility is also instructed to retain file permissions during copying. When executed, the script requests the user’s uniqname in order to log into AFS and get the path to the user’s directory. The user must then acknowledge they are connecting to the University's servers, and provide their password. The rsync utility will then copy the user’s AFS directory to a newly created directory that is named the same as the user’s uniqname inside the directory where the script was run. The download can be interrupted and will start where it left off once restarted.
