                <li>Download the script <a href="Linux_AFS_Migration.sh" target="_blank">here</a></li>
                <li>Navigate to your downloads folder in the terminal. This script will download files to the directory in which the script is executed, so you can move it to any directory you want.</li>

                <li>Change the permissions of the script using the line “chmod u+x Linux_AFS_Migration.sh”</li>
                <img src="Linux_Tutorial/L_2.png" width=500 height=300>
                <li>Execute the script. “./Linux_AFS_Migration.sh”</li>
                <img src="Linux_Tutorial/L_3.png" width=500 height=300>
                <li>Enter your uniqname.</li>
                <img src="Linux_Tutorial/L_4.png" width=500 height=300>
                <li>Certify that you understand you are connecting to a University of Michigan server by typing “yes” if requested. If you have connected remotely to this server before, you will not be prompted.</li>

                <li>Enter your password. Once the server accepts your login, the download will begin.</li>
                <li>Your files will appear in the directory in which the script was executed.</li>

        <h4>Tool Specifics:</h4>
        <div id="description">
            <p>This tool is a bash script for Linux users to copy files from their AFS directory to their local computer using the rsync utility. It can be executed in OS X following the same directions as listed below. This script does not copy hidden files, but that can be amended by removing both of the --exclude flags from the rsync command. The rsync utility is also instructed to retain file permissions during copying. When executed, the script requests the user’s uniqname in order to log into AFS and get the path to the user’s directory. The user must then acknowledge they are connecting to the University's servers, and provide their password. The rsync utility will then copy the user’s AFS directory to a newly created directory that is named the same as the user’s uniqname inside the directory where the script was run. The download can be interrupted and will start where it left off once restarted.
