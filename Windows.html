            <p>This tool makes use of PuTTY to securely transfer files from AFS to a local Windows computer using the SFTP protocol. It is compatible with any computer running Windows XP and up. This application downloads the AFS directory to the directory in which the application is run. Note for power users: this tool will not copy over any dotfiles from the top level directory.</p>
